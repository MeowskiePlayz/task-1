                <p style="font-size: 30px;">Diet and nutrition</p>
                <p style="font-size: 25px;">Ragdolls need a well-balanced diet to support their large size and maintain overall health. High-quality cat food rich in protein, vitamins, and healthy fats is essential. Wet and dry food options, especially those with animal-based proteins like chicken or fish, are recommended. It's important to follow a regular feeding schedule, ensuring proper portion control to prevent overeating and obesity. Fresh water should always be available. Additionally, supplementing with occasional treats can be beneficial, but moderation is key to maintain their ideal weight and health.</p>
